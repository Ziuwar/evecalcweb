  <p>Hello there, my in game name is Ziuwar. I played EvE-Online first back in 2003 (for a few month), but more regularly since 2010. I started this project to get rid of my excel files and to learn modern full stack web development. The site shall provide a quick overview of some important market prices and IÂ´m always looking for new calculations that are not already available on the web (if you have a suggestion go ahead and contact me).</p>
